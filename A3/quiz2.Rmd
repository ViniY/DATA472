## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(dplyr)
chess = read.csv("chess_data.csv")
head(chess,4)
q2base = chess[,c("victory_status", "winner", "black_rating", "white_rating")]
q2base = rename(q2base, match_outcome = victory_status)
q2dplyr = select(chess,match_outcome = victory_status, winner, black_rating, white_rating )


q3base = chess[grepl(pattern = "King's Pawn Game", chess$opening_name),]

q3dplyr= filter(chess, grepl("King's Pawn Game", opening_name))


q4base = chess[(chess$white_rating>=2000 & chess$black_rating >=2000),]
q4base
q4dplyr = filter(chess, chess$white_rating>=2000 & chess$black_rating >=2000)
q4dplyr
q5dplyr = chess %>%
          filter( chess$white_rating>=2000 & chess$black_rating >=2000) %>%
          select(match_outcome = victory_status, winner, black_rating, white_rating )
q5dplyr
chess$victory_status<- factor(chess$victory_status, levels=c("mate","resign","outoftime","draw"))
tapply(chess$turns, chess$victory_status, mean)
chess.tib <- as_tibble(chess) # Only if using "dplyr".
chess.tib %>%
  group_by(victory_status) %>%
  summarise(mean(turns))

arrange(chess, victory_status, turns)
chess[order(chess$victory_status,chess$turns),]
```
```{r}
# Install the "ggplot2" package.
install.packages("ggplot2")
# Load the "ggplot2" package.

```
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
plot.settings <- ggplot(chess, aes(x = height_cm, y = weight_kg)) + labs(x = "Height (cm)", y = "Weight (kg)") + theme_classic()
plot.settings + geom_point()
```
```{r}
plot.settings <- ggplot(chess, aes(x = white_rating, y = black_rating))+ labs(x = "whiteRating", y = "black") + theme_classic()
plot.settings + geom_point()
```





Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
